	<section id="about">

		<p>Distilled has been created to offer a different approach to information management from a "news & information" perspective.</p>

		<hr class="separator">

		<p>One of the primary issues is that complex topics are not translated - or, distilled - for general consumption. New channels themselves are not good at understanding topics or translating them, and the same can also be said about the pundits which are asked to speak.</p>

		<hr class="separator">

		<p>Distilled will offer a unique approach to acquiring information and knowledge about many topics. First, a simple and common headline about an event is given. These are listed on the left-hand sidebar. You will notice that there are three different colours that border these. The first one, red, is something that would be considered important or a priority - you should probably read these! Next, are the orange topics. These are topics that would be good to 'observe' - to have an idea that they are occurring and to think about, but that might not necessarily require your immediate attention or thought. Finally, the green-outlined headlines are 'upcoming' topics. These are topics which should also be observed, but whose end results or consequences may be further down the horizon. When you hover over a headline, a popup will appear which gives you the first distillation of that information - this will still be in relatively simple terms with the goal that anyone can understand, regarldess the topic being discussed. From here, you can dive further into a full analysis from Distilled and also find the article from which the original source has come. We will always prioritize a direct source (scientific article, etc). </p>
