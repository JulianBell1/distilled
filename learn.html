        <p>We are all scientists, although perhaps you didn't learn that this is inherent in the way you look at things in the world.<br>
        
        From the day we're born, we observe the world around us. With wide eyes we look in awe at people communicating, nature's wonders, the icecream cone again - with even wider eyes - after your first bite. <br> 

        Science is this observation, and then thinking "huh, I wonder if ... ". And so we test this wonder. And then we observe again: did what you originally think would work actually work when you tried it out, or did it come out a little differently than expected? If it was a bit different, you try again in the hopes of an outcome closer to the one you would like to see. We do this every single day - tinkering with your car, microwaving food again that wasn't quite warm enough the first time, playing Tear of The Kingdom and accidentally blowing yourself up while trying to defeat enemies. We observe, hypothesize, test, observe, and start the cycle over again. <br>
